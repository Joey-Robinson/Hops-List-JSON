# Hops-List-JSON

A large list of beer hops in a JSON doc. Includes name, some information, alpha-acid, beta-acid, flavors, purpose, and origin.

The link field is there because I haven't decided if I want to add links to everything just yet. Or if I even can.

Example Below

```json
    {
      "name": "Admiral",
      "origin": "England",
      "information": "Admiral is an excellent mid-season hops variety derived from grandparent Challenger and likely parent, Northdown. Its exact lineage is unclear. Hailing from Wye College, England it was released to the brewing world in 1998 as a potential high-alpha replacement or complimentary addition to Target hops.",
      "purpose": "Bittering",
      "flavorProfile": "Aggressive but smooth bittering with an orange-citrus and herbal resonance",
      "alphaAcid": "13%-16.2%",
      "betaAcid": "4.8%-6.1%",
      "link": ""
    }
```
